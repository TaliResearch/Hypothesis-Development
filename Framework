What are the steps for forming a specific hypothesis of trading strategy and steps to test the hypothesis.

"""
Over the scheme of work for developing quant strategies we build and utilise four major components:
1. Hypothesis formulation and testing - Finding and defining a clearly specified testable strategy
2. Backtesting and optimizing the hypothesis -  Data wrangling, munging, separation, prototyping and building the strategy, backtest, walk forward, analyse the performance
3. Strategy Automation - Linking to brokerage lines and data pipelines
4. Risk and Portfolio management - Optimal capital allocation, optimising for bid-ask size spread and more...






5 Core Hypothesis Setting Steps
1. State the suggested hypothesis
2. Set the relevant decision criterion
3. Define the test statistics and thresholds 
4. Calculate the test statistics
5. Make a decision against the decision criterion and test statistic thresholds
