What are the steps for forming a specific hypothesis of trading strategy and steps to test the hypothesis.
"""

Over the scheme of work for developing quant strategies we build and utilise four major components:

1. Hypothesis formulation and testing - Finding and defining a clearly specified testable strategy
2. Backtesting and optimizing the hypothesis -  Data wrangling, munging, separation, prototyping and building the strategy, backtest, walk forward, analyse the performance
