What are the steps for forming a specific hypothesis of trading strategy and steps to test the hypothesis.
"""

Over the scheme of work for developing quant strategies we build and utilise four major components:

1. Hypothesis formulation and testing - Finding and defining a clearly specified testable strategy
2. Backtesting and optimizing the hypothesis -  Data wrangling, munging, separation, prototyping and building the strategy, backtest, walk forward, analyse the performance
3. Strategy Automation - Linking to brokerage lines and data pipelines
4. Risk and Portfolio management - Optimal capital allocation, optimising for bid-ask size spread and more...

1. Hypothesis formulation and testing - Finding and defining a clearly specified testable strategy
Hypothesis testing is a systematic way to test a hypothesis or idea about the population - aoout our investment universe/ the market.
We measure the behaviour of samples to learn more about the wider population, we use samples as a representation of the populations 
that interest us - within relevant boundary and relevance conditions.


5 Core Hypothesis Setting Steps
1. State the suggested hypothesis
2. Set the relevant decision criterion
3. Define the test statistics and thresholds 
4. Calculate the test statistics
5. Make a decision against the decision criterion and test statistic thresholds
